# Contributing to Multifamily AI Valuation

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Multifamily AI Valuation platform as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mutlifamily-ai-valuation.git
   cd mutlifamily-ai-valuation
   ```

2. **Set up development environment with Docker:**
   ```bash
   # Start development environment
   npm run docker:dev
   
   # Or manual setup
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Configure environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.docker .env.local
   # Update with your development configuration
   ```

4. **Verify setup:**
   - Application: http://localhost:3000
   - Health check: http://localhost:3000/health

## 📋 Development Process

We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: All new code should be written in TypeScript
- **ESLint**: Follow the established ESLint configuration
- **Prettier**: Code formatting is handled automatically
- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables and functions

### Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(dashboard): add real-time property analytics
fix(auth): resolve Google OAuth redirect issue
docs(docker): update installation instructions
refactor(api): improve error handling in export routes
```

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** for any new features
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Ensure all tests pass** before submitting
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes
5. **Request review** from maintainers

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Test coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Docker environment tests
docker-compose exec app npm test
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases

### Test Structure

```javascript
describe('Component/Feature Name', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  it('should perform expected behavior', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle error cases', () => {
    // Error handling tests
  });
});
```

## 📝 Documentation

### Code Documentation

- **JSDoc**: Document complex functions and components
- **README**: Update if you change setup or installation

- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
